GUT CHECK: HARNESSING MACHINE LEARNING TO DETECT INTESTINAL


This project, "Gut Check: Harnessing Machine Learning to Detect Intestinal Diseases," focuses on applying machine learning and deep learning models to classify gastrointestinal (GI) diseases using the Kvasir dataset, which consists of labeled endoscopic images across eight disease categories. Traditional machine learning models such as Linear Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used to establish baseline performance before advancing to deep learning architectures like MobileNetV3, VGG19, and InceptionV3. Model effectiveness was assessed based on accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrices. While traditional models provide a useful starting point, they struggle with complex medical image patterns. In contrast, deep learning models, particularly InceptionV3, demonstrated the highest accuracy and generalization capabilities, making them more suitable for GI disease classification.

Findings indicate that InceptionV3, with a validation accuracy of 93%, is the most reliable model for this application, significantly outperforming other architectures. VGG19 also delivered strong results, while MobileNetV3, though efficient, showed limitations in handling intricate image features. This project highlights the potential of deep learning in improving diagnostic accuracy for medical imaging. Future work will focus on optimizing these models further by exploring hybrid architectures, integrating interpretability tools like Grad-CAM to enhance transparency, and testing the models in real-world clinical settings. Refining these techniques will contribute to the advancement of AI-assisted medical diagnostics, particularly for endoscopy-based disease detection.
